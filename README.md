# Challenge 5: Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This project is a webpage that is displaying a work day scheduler. It was a project built using a third party api, localStorage, data attributes, and other important fundamentals of a website.
The webpage features a dynamic date in the header, dynamic coloring of each section depending on the time of day, and storing the text locally when clicking the save button for each section.

This project was pretty fair given that the starter code gave most of the html. Nonetheless, it was a good learning experience regarding the basics of localStorage and navigating DOM elements.

## Installation

To install the project, clone the repository onto your PC.
Enter the directory that has the cloned repository and open (Double click) the index.html, style.css and script.js files to read the code and access the files.

## Usage

Right off the bat there is a title and header describing the functionality of the daily calendar. The date in the header is dynamic and will change according to the today's date. There are
hourly sections that can be typed in when clicked. The user can type in any text and click the floppy disc/save icon to store that text into the local storage, allowing the text to persist, 
even after refreshing. The sections are also color coded based on the time of day. Grey represents the past, red is the present, and green is the future.
